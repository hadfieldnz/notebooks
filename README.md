# workbooks


This project (hadfieldnz/notebooks) is a repository of Jupyter notebooks maintained by
by Mark Hadfield, now emeritus at at NIWA. It complements and may eventually replace
a similar "notebooks-mgh" repository that is accessible only within NIWA.

Efficient storage of the notebooks on Git repositories has been achieved (I hope) by the
method described here:
